#Voting System

## *What We Do*
This project is a blockchain-based voting system designed to ensure secure, transparent, and immutable election processes. It utilizes a central ledger (blockchain) integrated with a database management system (DBMS). The system is built using Django for the backend, React for the frontend, and SQLite3 as the database


## Features

- **Secure Voting**: Blockchain ensures integrity and transparency.
- **User Authentication**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for security.
- **Election Logic**: Handles election logic and vote counting.
- **Automated Elections**: Elections begin and end based on predefined schedules.


## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: React (HTML, CSS)
- **Database**: SQLite3
